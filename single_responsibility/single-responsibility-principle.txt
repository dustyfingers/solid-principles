each software component should have one and only one reponsibility!

2 big words - COHESION and COUPLING


COHESION

cohesion is the degree to which the various parts of a software component are related

think about a big pile of garbage vs a neat row of well sorted containers

think about Square and SquareUI...by splitting the responsibilities up, we increase the cohesion of BOTH classes

higher cohesion helps attain better adherence to the single responsibility principle!


COUPLING

coupling is the level of interdependency between various software components

think about warrens code - he has a class for everything (eg interfacing with DDB)
so that if we change the db we are using, we just have to write another db class and update the references!
loosely coupled, but cohesive


ALTERNATE DEFINITION:
uncle bob phrases this principle as 'each software component should have one and only one reason to change'
